# Missile_Modeling_Simulation
Air-to-Air Missile Simulation written in modern Fortran
This is newer and updated version of my older "Missile Simulation" project
written in C++.
Main changes are related to drastically improved modeling of Radar interaction
with targets and environment.
T-Matrix models(by Mishchenko and by Xu) will be used to compute scattering coefficients returned by
single particles and ensemble of particles.
Discrete Dipole Approximation (by modified program: DDscat) will be used to compute scattering by
aircrafts and missiles.
